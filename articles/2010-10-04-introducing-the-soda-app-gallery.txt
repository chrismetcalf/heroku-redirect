title: Introducing the SODA App Gallery
date: 04/10/2010

I'm pleased to announce the launch of the [Socrata Open Data API "App Gallery"](/gallery) on dev.socrata.com:

[![Socrata Open Data API App Gallery](/images/posts/2010-10-04-app-gallery.png)](/gallery)

Initially I've included a number of apps that were built based on data from [Data.Seattle.gov](http://data.seattle.gov), many of which were built during the [Tinkerstorm 24-hour Hackathon](http://blog.tropo.com/2010/08/23/opengov-hackathon-wrapup-and-the-winners/), but the catalog will expand over time to include [your submissions](/submit-your-app/).

If you've built something with the SODA API, please don't forget to [submit it for inclusion](/submit-your-app). Your submission will also automatically make you eligible for future app contests and awards.
