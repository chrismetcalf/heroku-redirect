I'm [Chris Metcalf](http://www.socrata.com/profile/Chris-Metcalf/i7d8-sc4w), Socrata's new "Developer Evangelist." It's a big fancy title, but it basically means I'm here to help you get started with the Socrata Open Data API, and make sure your experience as a whole is a positive one.

Over the coming weeks, I'll be expanding this developer site to turn it into a one-stop resource for building applications and mashups using the SODA APIs. I'll be adding guides on how to use our APIs to discover, retrieve, and manipulate data, and I'll be providing examples in a number of different programming languages.

For more help, you can join the conversation on our [GetSatisfaction Developer Forum](http://community.socrata.com/socrata/products/socrata_socrata_open_data_api) or even contact me directly at `chris dot metcalf at socrata dot com`. And please feel free to suggest content you'd like to see on the developer site.

Thanks, and I look forward to working with you to build a thriving community around the Socrata Open Data API. Let's work together on this.
