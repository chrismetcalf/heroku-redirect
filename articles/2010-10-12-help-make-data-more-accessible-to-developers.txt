date: 12/10/2010

In cooperation with the [Sunlight Foundation](http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/), [Personal Democracy Forum](http://www.personaldemocracy.com/), [GovLoop](http://www.govloop.com/), [Code for America](http://www.codeforamerica.org/), and [David Eaves](http://eaves.ca), Socrata has launched the third phase of its [Open Government Data Benchmark Study](http://www.socrata.com/benchmark-study/developer-survey), this time focused on civic application developers.

I invite you to take five to ten minutes out and help out the community by [letting us know what's most important to developers](http://www.socrata.com/benchmark-study/developer-survey) when it comes to working with open government data. If you want to talk more about what open data means to you as a developer, feel free to drop me a line directly at [chris.metcalf@socrata.com](mailto:chris.metcalf@socrata.com) or [@chrismetcalf](http://twitter.com/chrismetcalf).
