[Socrata](http://www.socrata.com) is proud to announce that it is partnering with the team from [Tropo](http://www.tropo.com) to host a 24-hour Open Government hackathon at this year's [Gnomedex](http://www.gnomedex.com/) conference in Seattle, WA.

The hackathon starts on Saturday, August 21st at 5PM and runs for a full 24 hours. After the 24 hours are over, our judges will select which individual or team has created the best open government application, and the winner will receive the shiny new [Apple iPad](http://www.apple.com/ipad/) that is currently sitting on my desk taunting me.

If you want to join us, make sure you head over to the [Eventbrite page](http://gnomedex10hackathon.eventbrite.com/) and sign up so we know you're coming. You don't need to have a conference badge to attend, and the event is free. We'll be bringing some developers from Socrata, and we're also hoping for some special guests from both the government sector and the Gov2.0 community.
