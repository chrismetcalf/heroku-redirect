We always like seeing the community pitching in and showcasing how powerful SODA can be when combined with meaningful open data. Today I wanted to highlight <a href="http://metrochicagoopendataexamples.blogspot.com/">Metro Chicago Open Data Examples</a>, written by Stephen Newell.

Over the past two months, Stephen has been posting a series of great posts showing how to do various tasks working with open data in Python, and much of it has to do with the Socrata Open Data API. If you wanted to see step-by-step, for example, how to create an inline filter on some data, he's written about it <a href="http://metrochicagoopendataexamples.blogspot.com/2011/09/example-16-complex-query-using-inline.html">here</a>. Or, if you need to be able to page through a large amount of data on the API, there's an example you can use <a href="http://metrochicagoopendataexamples.blogspot.com/2011/09/example-21-getting-data-via-paging.html">here</a>.

If you have written anything else (sample code, walkthroughs, or otherwise) that might help your fellow civic developers get acclimated with the open data platform, please do write to us and let us know; I'd be happy to feature your work here. For now, though, read up on <a href="http://metrochicagoopendataexamples.blogspot.com/2011/08/introduction.html">the genesis</a> of the Metro Chicago Open Data Examples blog and <a href="https://github.com/snewell4/Metro-Chicago-Open-Data-Examples">grab the code off of GitHub</a> if you're at all interested in Python development on the Socrata Open Data API.
