Socrata is proud to be hosting the Seattle branch of the 2011 [International Open Data Hackathon](http://www.opendataday.org/) at our offices in Pioneer Square. For the uninitiated, the International Open Data Hackathon is a loosely-connected event of hackathons in different cities around the world with a common goal of getting as many people around the world hacking on open data at the same time. It's a great chance for the community to connect around some common goals and build some awesome tech.

The Seattle event will be hosted at [Socrata's offices](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrQjz9FccLk) right in downtown Seattle. We've got space for maybe 20-30 developers if we spread out around the office, plently of bandwidth, and a great view of Pioneer Square. My personal goal is to hack on some of the awesome restaurant inspection data provided by [Chicago](http://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Food-Inspections/4ijn-s7e5), [King County](http://www.datakc.org/Government/Food-Establishment-Inspection-Data/f29f-zza5), and the [City of New York](http://nycopendata.socrata.com/Health/Restaurant-Inspection-Results/zf7n-cm69), but I also welcome people to come work on whatever catches their fancy.

We'll plan on starting up at about 9AM and sticking around until 6PM, but if people want to keep working later or head out to socialize we're always game. If you're interested in attending, please [sign up on EventBrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2534161746) so we know to expect you. That'll also make sure we have enough refreshments to keep you energized throughout the day!

I'll also be available on the hackathon [IRC channel](http://www.opendataday.org/wiki/Main_Page) as "metcalf" if people need help with the [Socrata APIs](http://dev.socrata.com)
