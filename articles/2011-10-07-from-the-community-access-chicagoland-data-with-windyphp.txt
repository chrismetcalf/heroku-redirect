Something amazing is happening in Chicago. The [City of Chicago](http://data.cityofchiago.org), [Cook County](http://data.cookcountyil.gov), and [State of Illinois](http://data.illinois.gov/) all are coming together around the cause of Open Data and are publishing awesome datasets to their collective data sites, and a great developer community is coming together around this influx of new data.

[Paul Weinstein](http://pdw.weinstein.org/) has put together an awesome PHP library, [Windy.php](http://pdw.weinstein.org/2011/09/accessing-chicago-cook-and-illinois-open-data-via-php.html), in order to help PHP developers get started accessing data from the city, county, and state. It wraps up all the complexities of accessing the different datasites into a neat library and even helps you retreive and parse KML files.

For you Ruby hackers, there's also the [windy.rb](https://github.com/Chicago/windy) module, which provides a similar interface for accessing City of Chicago data from Ruby.
