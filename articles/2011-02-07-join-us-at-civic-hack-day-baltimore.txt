Now that the Socrata-powered [OpenBaltimore](http://data.baltimorecity.gov) is officially launched, I'm excited to be joining the gang from [Tropo](http://www.tropo.com) on Saturday, February 12 for [Civic Hack Day](http://civichackday.eventbrite.com/) at the [Beehive](http://beehivebaltimore.org/). It should be a great opportunity for everybody to start getting their hands dirty with Baltimore's new data site and build some awesome apps using the SODA API. I'm looking forward to interacting with the Baltimore open data community to see what we can create together.

So, if you're in the Baltimore area and you're interested in open data, [come hack with us!](http://civichackday.eventbrite.com/)
