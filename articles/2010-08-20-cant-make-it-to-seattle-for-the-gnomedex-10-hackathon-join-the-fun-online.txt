Can't make it to Seattle for the Gnomedex [Tinkerstorm 2010 hackathon](/blog/2010/08/12/join-socrata-at-the-gnomedex-10-open-government-hackathon-and-win-an-ipad/)? Join us online!

We've set up a number of online resources to make it easy for those who can't make it to join in online and collaborate with the rest of us:

* [#tinkerstorm on chat.us.freenode.net](irc://chat.us.freenode.net/tinkerstorm) - We'll be hanging out on IRC all weekend to collaborate, and you're free to join in and ask questions or just hang out.
* [Tinkerstorm Wiki](http://tinkerstorm-2010.wikispaces.com/) - We'll be posting
  links to documentation, developer profiles, and other useful resources.
* [Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/tinkerstorm-2010) - Join our
  Google Group to help keep in touch after the event and find ongoing support.

And don't worry. If you participate in the 24-hour hackathon remotely, you'll
still get a chance at the free iPad.
