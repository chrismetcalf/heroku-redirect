Socrata is excited to be taking part in the [Open Gov West](http://www.opengovwest.org/events/conference/opengovwest-11/) [Cross-Gov Civic Apps Contest](http://www.opengovwest.org/events/conference/opengovwest-11/1304-2/) on May 14, 2011. 

As we've done with several of our hackathons in the past, we're partnering up with our good friends at [Tropo](http://www.tropo.com) for this event. It runs from 9AM to 7PM on Saturday, May 14, and we're excited to have a great group of government participants from across the Pacific Northwest, including representatives from the Portland, Seattle, King County, and the State of Oregon.

The theme of the event is "cross-government applications", and Socrata and Tropo will be kicking in prizes for the teams that build the best apps judged by the following criteria:

* The top three projects will be awarded prizes based on the following criteria:
* Most innovation use of technology.
* Problem or public policy imperative addressed.
* Reusability of solution or service by multiple governments.
* Use of multiple data sets or APIs.
* Availability of source code or application to interested governments.

For more details, see the [contest rules](http://www.opengovwest.org/events/conference/opengovwest-11/1304-2/cross-gov-apps-contest-rules/).
