    <h2>HTTP Basic Authentication</h2>

    <p>Requests can be authenticated by passing in HTTP Basic Authentication headers, and in a subsequent release of the API we will also support authentication by OAuth 2.0. Authentication is not required for most Consumer API requests.</p>

    <h3>Examples:</h3>

    <p>Using HTTP Basic Authentication:</p>
<pre>
&gt; curl --user login:pass https://opendata.socrata.com/api/views/644b-gaut/rows.json
</pre>

    <h2>Application Tokens and Throttling</h2>

    <p>While it is possible to perform simple queries against the Socrata Open Data API without making use of an application token, you'll receive much higher throttling limits if you <a href="/register">register your application</a> and include it in your requests. In the near future when we roll out support for <code>OAuth 2.0</code> your application token will also become part of your application's authentication workflow.</p>

    <p>You can include your application token using either the <code>app_token</code> parameter on your request, or using the <code>X-APP-TOKEN</code> HTTP header. Application tokens are not used for authentication, but you should still preserve the security of your application token by always using <code>HTTPS</code> requests.</p>

    <p>Making a request using an application token as a parameter:</p>
<pre>
&gt; curl https://opendata.socrata.com/api/views/644b-gaut/rows.json?app_token=b6bThWI6I3dJfulFek8JRizjo
</pre>

    <p>Using an application token in the HTTP header:</p>
<pre>
&gt; curl --header "X-APP-TOKEN: b6bThWI6I3dJfulFek8JRizjo" https://opendata.socrata.com/api/views/644b-gaut/rows.json
</pre>
