# Updating rows in a dataset

SODA2 allows rows in a dataset to be added, removed and updated though standard REST operations.  These operations will
mostly occur on the row's endpoint.  See the [endpoint](/soda2/endpoints) documentation to see how these are constructed.

## Adding a row

To add a row in SODA2, simply post a JSON representation of the object to add.  For example, to add a new nomination
to the `nominationsCopy` dataset, you would post:

      {
        "position" : "Test Agent",
        "nomination_date" : "2012-09-10T13:32:10.000",
        "agency_website" : "https://sandbox.demo.socrata.com",
        "holdover" : false,
        "agency_name" : "Department of Testing",
        "confirmed" : false,
        "name" : "cd4a3311-2035-4ec0-9cec-3fef78695a3c"
      }

to the URL

  https://sandbox.demo.socrata.com/resource/nominationsCopy

This will add the new record to the dataset, and will return with the following response:

      {
        ":id" : 79,
        ":created_at" : "2012-09-17T20:32:46.781Z",
        ":updated_at" : "2012-09-17T20:32:46.781Z",
        ":created_meta" : "692989",
        ":updated_meta" : "692989",
        ":position" : 79,
        "position" : "Test Agent",
        "nomination_date" : "2012-09-10T13:32:10.000",
        "agency_website" : "https://sandbox.demo.socrata.com",
        "holdover" : false,
        "agency_name" : "Department of Testing",
        "confirmed" : false,
        "name" : "cd4a3311-2035-4ec0-9cec-3fef78695a3c"
      }

Notice, that there are a few system fields automatically added.  These all start with a '**:**', these are all for internal
bookkeeping.  They can all be added to a select statement in queries to be returned, however, only three of these are generally useful
to a user.

|System Field|Description|
|---|---|
|:id|This is the id the system created for this record.  If the dataset does not have a unique identifier set, this will be the unique identifier.|
|:created_at|This is the timestamp for when this record was created.|
|:updated_at|This is the timestamp for when this record was last updated.|

## Updating a row

Updating a row is very similiar to adding a row, only you POST the row to the row's endpoint.  For example, you would post

      {
        "position" : "Test Agent",
        "nomination_date" : "2012-09-10T13:32:10.000",
        "agency_website" : "https://sandbox.demo.socrata.com",
        "holdover" : false,
        "agency_name" : "Department of Testing",
        "confirmed" : false,
        "name" : "cd4a3311-2035-4ec0-9cec-3fef78695a3c"
      }

to the URL

    https://sandbox.demo.socrata.com/resource/nominationsCopy/79

The response will be the same as for adding a row.

## Getting a row

To get a row, you simply need to do a GET against the row's endpoint.  You can use the same ways of specifying format
as general queries.  E.g.

    https://sandbox.demo.socrata.com/resource/nominationsCopy/79.json

## Deleting a row

To delete a row, you simple need to do an HTTP DELETE operation on the row's endpoint.
