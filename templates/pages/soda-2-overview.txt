# Providing Access to Open Data via Open APIs
## An Introduction to SODA: the Socrata Open Data API

The _Socrata Open Data API_ creates an easy way to make data accessible on the web in a powerful way.

If your organization needs to provide access to data, to the public or to an internal
group, you are faced with a challenging technical problem. How should the data be presented? How
should it be sorted? What terms and search parameters
should be included? How should it be organized and stored? How are users notified about
changes to the data?

And in the course of developing a technical solution, organizations are faced with multiple
technical and human layers of interaction as data is stored, updated, and presented to
the end users. Displaying current, accessible data to the target audience in an appropriate, secure,
user-friendly way can become a huge project and a real drain on an organization's
resources.

SODA 2.0 helps your organization solve these problems by providing groups that use your data
with flexible, access tools in the form of an "API". API stands for "application programming interface."
Using an API instead of a fixed solution means that instead of putting your data into any
particular format, SODA 2.0 provides the end-users of your data with a _toolkit_ for accessing it.
This allows them to format, sort, search, and name data in the way that makes sense to them
according to how they think about and use it.

## Why APIs Matter

As evidence of the value and importance of APIs, let's look at the adoption of two well-utilized,
public government datasets: Census TIGER (Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing) files and NOAA weather data.

The U.S. Census Bureau has captured geographic data about roads, buildings, rivers, lakes,
census tracts, and many other geographic attributes, since the 1960 census. Many companies - 
hundreds or even thousands - make use of these TIGER files for their own geographic
analysis and incorporation into products that require geographic context.

The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) also publishes a vast amount of data.
NOAA's weather data has become the backbone of the entire meteorology industry, from the weather reports
in your morning newspaper and nightly TV newscast, to weather forecasts, and public safety. The
data is also used for preparedness and evacuation in advance of weather-related threats, and even for
sophisticated crop insurance markets that provide farmers with a hedge against catastrophic losses
caused by Mother Nature.

Both weather data and geographic data are widely shown on the web.
In just a few keystrokes we can find accurate 5-day weather forecasts for virtually any location on the
planet. And millions of websites provide geographic context to the information they make
available by providing visually rich maps. Geographically showing the locations of services or the relative
density of some value over geographic boundaries - unemployment by state, for example.

Where these case studies diverge, however, is important to understand.

The Census Bureau to this day does not provide an API to access TIGER data. Most maps on the web today are
powered by Google, not by Census. Google created the simple, elegant, easy to use Google Maps API which has
become the world's most popular API. There are many more applications that use the Google Maps API
than any other API.

For weather data NOAA has long offered API access. Even though it's no longer modern or based on open,
well-accepted standards, NOAA provides programmatic access to climate data to the entire weather industry.
NOAA operates as the heart of a healthy ecosystem, rhythmically pumping out weather data via
its API. The weather industry absorbs this data in real-time.

The absence of an API retarded the adoption and promulgated use of Census' TIGER data; the
presence of APIs stimulated adoption and widespread direct and indirect use of NOAA data.

The value of API access to data can't be overstated. The ultimate use cases
often can't be imagined. No one anticipated that the multi-billion dollar
weather and vehicle navigation markets would form around public weather and global positioning
system data, for example.

It will be exciting to see what additional multi-billion dollar industries emerge
around data from energy, health, education, transportation and other categories of data once
it's available online and API enabled. And it will be rewarding to see the public safety, quality of life, and
government efficiency gains that will come when all public data is accessible.
One can imagine this data being used by civic developers, public safety agencies, emergency
management and crisis response organizations, health researchers, and many others.
Not to mention government agencies leveraging each other's APIs to increase inter-agency collaboration.

What's important here is not just the availability of data, but _how_ it's made available. Raw data
or data in difficult proprietary formats stifles access and innovation. Data made available though
APIs, especially APIs using open, accepted standards, sparks innovation and creativity. Experience
has shown that making your data available via an API is the most effective, and powerful, means of delivery.

## How SODA 2.0 Works

The cloud-hosted, __Socrata Open Data Platform__ automatically provides access to data using an efficient
architectural standard for web services called __REST__. REST stands for _Representational State Transfer_ and has
quickly become the standard way for web-based applications of all kinds to easily access and
manipulate data.

All an organization needs to do in order to "create" an API for a dataset with SODA 2.0 is to
upload that dataset into the Socrata platform. Think of SODA 2.0 as an _API builder_ rather
than as an API itself. It provides a dataset-specific, general purpose API for any set of data.

SODA 2.0 is an open platform. The specifications for SODA are non-proprietary, contributed in 2010
by Socrata to the Open Data community via a Creative Commons license. APIs built with SODA use only
non-proprietary conventions and open standards including HTTP, REST, XML, JSON, RDF and SQL (using
a variant we call SoQL).

In addition, SODA 2.0 was designed to be flexible. It places few constraints on
the structure of data and supports three common use cases:

* __Ad-hoc analysis__ - SODA 2.0 provides expressive query semantics and results returned in downloadable,
tabular file formats;

* __Web and mobile application development__ - SODA 2.0 provides high performance access to data and
results returned in readily consumable formats such as JSON or XML;

* __Semantic data modeling and exploration__ - SODA 2.0 provides a stable URL/URI structure,
dereference-able data types and results returned in a consumable RDF format.

## SODA at work - an example

Exploring an example of an API automatically created by SODA can help make these concepts more tangible.
The White House publishes a dataset containing the names of individuals who have been appointed to
office in the current administration.

The dataset has an external dataset name of "White House Nominations & Appointments" and a _resource name_
of "nominations."

Here's what the dataset looks like on <http://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/nominations-and-appointments>:
![Alt Screen shot from White House website](img/SODA_2_Overview_diagram1.png)

The White House choose to display a simple columnar display of data which can be sorted by
column.

But SODA provides another level of access to the consumers of this data. As it does for every dataset,
SODA creates a read-only, publicly accessible REST interface into the dataset. Using the standard
convention for RESTful APIs, SODA calls this a "resource."

The action verb to query data from a resource in the standard web protocol HTTP is GET. GET is a
request to retrieve data over the standard HTTP protocol used by all web browsers. Technically, GET operates
like the SELECT statement in Structured Query Language (SQL), or like a read() function
in lower-level languages.

Using the stable URL/URI structure provided automatically by SODA 2.0 the GET command for reading
data programmatically through a SODA-created API is:

    GET /resource/dataset-name[.fmt]?column-name[=value][&column-name[=value]...]

For example the follow example queries the database in a single HTTP GET request for any nominees to
the position of "Deputy Attorney General" who also have a true value in the "confirmed" column.

    GET /resource/nominations?position=Deputy Attorney General&confirmed

<!--
Chris: I'd like to replace this diagram with something new, is that something you can do?
Tim: sure - just tell me more about what you'd like, this diagram is fairly clear, what don't you like about it?
Chris: For lack of a better descriptor, something "cleaner" looking. I'll check with our designer, he may
have a better idea.
-->

The elements of this request are diagrammed here:

![Alt Explaining the elements of a GET request](img/SODA_2_Overview_diagram2.png)

Note that this response is formatted in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation),
one of several standard return types provided by SODA 2.0.

The request simply requires the web developer to know the resource name and the columns available.
This meta-data about the dataset is readily available to developers, also through REST, by
querying the catalog dataset automatically created by Socrata on upload.

|Externally Visible Column Name|Short Name|Data Type|
| ---------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
|Name|name|Text|
|Agency|agency|URL|
|Position|position|Text|
|Formal Nomination Date|nomination_date|Date|
|Confirmation Vote|vote_date|Date|
|Confirmed|confirmed|Boolean|
|Held Over?|holdover|Boolean|

The request is a non-proprietary, conventional GET request issued over HTTP. The response is a
non-proprietary, conventional JSON response delivered over HTTP. While the API defaults to returning
its response in JSON, the response is client configurable such that the requester can alternatively
request the response to be emitted in RDF, XML or CSV instead of JSON by specifying an appropriate
HTTP Accept content-type header or format suffix to the resource:

    GET /resource/nominations.xml?position=Deputy Attorney General&confirmed

    GET /resource/nominations.rdf?position=Deputy Attorney General&confirmed

This is a very simple example, but such simple GET requests compromise the fast majority of data user's needs.  When more sophisticated slices of the data are required SODA 2.0 goes much further.

For example, expressive query semantics are being added to SODA 2.0 to allow developers to use expressions
based on SQL for dynamically accessing only the rows within a dataset that meet certain criteria:

    GET /resource/people
        $where=age > 17 and family_name=Peterson
        $order=family_name, age, given_name

SODA has evolved through market use and developer feedback and we continue
to extend and enhance SODA. The architecture of the API and the flexibility of our query language allow us
to easily add features to the API without impacting existing applications.

## SODA Adoption
External developers need not even know that an API for a dataset is built on SODA; however, SODA has
become the de facto standard API in use by more than 30 governments and NGOs: New York City, Chicago,
Illinois and World Bank, for example. Developers have embraced SODA as a conventional way to
programmatically access any data source. By adopting open, standards-based, conventional and market
adopted APIs, Data.Gov can further reduce friction that discourages developers from developing
applications with public, government data.

## Levels of Access with SODA

The example above demonstrates how developers access public data in a read-only manner. SODA allows
data publishers to offer three modes of public, read-only access to a dataset:

* Anonymous, unauthenticated, heavily rate-limited access to data;
* Authenticated, moderately rate-limited access to data;
* Authenticated access to data with minimal rate limitation;

The read-only access to data we saw in the example above is provided by the Consumer API.
SODA offers three API families, each with unique use cases and data access patterns:

1.	__Consumer API__ - read-only access, generally used by civic developers and industry to create
applications with public, government data. The Consumer API can also be used by agencies to access
other agencies' public data or by developers or agencies to access gain read-only, authenticated or
anonymous access to data.

2.	__Publisher API__ - fully authenticated, read/write access, used by data owners to update their data
and metadata programmatically. Providing an efficient way to share data is one half of the data
coin. The other is an efficient means of publishing updates. The Publisher API allows organizations
to tie into the underlying business systems that capture and create the primary data to automate these
updates. The only way for the large organizations to tackle publishing large data sets in an efficient
and timely way is through automation. By automatically publishing data as it's updated in its home
systems even massive data sets can stay up to date.

3.	__Federation API__ - fully authenticated, read/write access to catalog-level metadata only, used
by organizations that want to federate their data catalog to other Socrata-powered
datasites such as Data.gov from an in-house developed or 3rd-party provided, non-Socrata-powered datasite.

Chris: Honestly, I don't think so, but it's part of the overall model, so I'll leave it in.

## Supporting Your Efforts

While API access to data is optimal in many ways, an API alone is not sufficient to make your data
truly accessible to other users and organizations. To be effective and productive, developers (inside
your organization and in related organizations) require additional resources to reduce the barriers
that prevent them from developing applications that display or use your data. While APIs stand
supreme in providing flexible access to data, they do require a layer of at least simple programming
to serve the data from your dataset to users.

The developer resources Socrata provides for SODA 2.0 implementation include:

* Thorough and complete documentation of the APIs; <!-- Tim: I'd better get to work!!!; Chris: Yup :) -->
* Sample source code in a number of popular programming languages that can be modified without licensing restrictions;
* Getting started tutorials and videos;
* An interactive console with live data that allows developers to explore the APIs;
* A community where best practices, ideas and problems can be shared with each other and
with developer evangelists who are intimately familiar with the APIs.

![Alt Screen shot from the Socrata Developer Site](img/SODA_2_Overview_diagram3.png)

Socrata has developed and operates the SODA developer site at
[http://dev.socrata.com](http://dev.socrata.com). It offers complete API documentation;
reference materials; getting started guides, text and video tutorials; a developer blog authored by
Socrata developer evangelists; discussion forums; an application gallery
describing apps built with public, government data; and an interactive API console that lets developers
issue API commands against live data and immediately see the response.

The SODA developer site can optionally be delivered in a privately-branded experience, and a fully-skinned
developer website can be provided with custom content tailored to a particular customer's data and use cases.

## Avoiding the Dangers of Vendor Lock-in

The world of software and data is a rapidly changing space. Many companies and government agencies
have suffered greatly from "vendor lock-in" in which adoption of a software platform creates significant
problems later on, often at enormous expense. Problems happen when the adopted platform is later
changed, discontinued, or becomes obsolete or inappropriate; or the organization's needs change in a way
that exceeds the capacities of the platform.

Vendor lock-in has made organizations understandably weary about adoption of technology, often causing
the continuation of obsolete and inefficient technologies, or the development of expensive custom-built proprietary
systems which in the end result in the same problems as the commercial platforms being avoided!

Socrata is well aware of these issues with longevity and change. Socrata is the most widely adopted
Open Data solution in the world. To protect the interest of our users and clients throughout the
world we have documented our API specifications and released them under a Creative Commons license.
This means that all interfaces into the entire Socrata platform are replicable without infringement on any
Socrata intellectual property. Anyone can recreate it without concern of legal repercussion.

If you felt the need to replace Socrata you (or a contractor you hire) could build a 100% compatible
replacement.  You could invite companies to create functional equivalents using Socrata's API
specifications.

The metadata and data in the Socrata platform are also completely open and accessible. If you wanted
to move from Socrata to an another data hosting solution, you could either republish the data
from the underlying primary systems of record or you could use the Socrata APIs to extract the data
from Socrata and republish into another data hosting platform. Using Socrata APIs you retain
complete control of your data and the very nature of our product - flexible, open standards - prevents
vendor lock-in.

## Why Choose Socrata?

While other vendors are working the API generation and programming space, Socrata has been a pioneer,
innovator and thought leader in the emerging Open Data market since 2007. The Socrata Open Data
Platform&trade; is the most widely-adopted Open Data solution in Government. Socrata customers include
Medicare, State of Washington and City of Seattle. Socrata was recently chosen to deliver the
next-generation Open Data platform for Data.Gov and participating federal agencies, through its GSA
reseller and fulfillment partner, Alamo City Engineering Services.

This position has been attained by operating honestly and as openly. Socrata
voluntarily elected to contribute its API specifications to the Open Data community via a non-restrictive,
Creative Commons license in early 2010. Socrata voluntarily rewrote SODA in late 2011 to make it entirely
non-Socrata specific, removing all Socrata conventions and ensuring only open standards were utilized.

These two acts have effectively made it easy for anyone to recreate the Socrata Open Data API and
serve as a convincing argument that Socrata puts its customers long term interests first.

## Growing Success with Government Data

Socrata's initial successes is in providing open hosting of data for U.S. Government
agencies such as the Government Services Agency (GSA) which hosts more than 64 million rows of
data in over 5,800 datasets with Socrata.

Our success in this sector shows the huge potential of this technology to save money and
increase benefit for governmental and commercial entities alike. Anyone with data can benefit by adopting
Socrata's SODA 2.0 API.

In the governmental sector that we know well we see enormous benefits would be enjoyed if there were
an open, standards-based, consistent, government-wide API for _every_ public government dataset.
The most expeditious path to achieving that goal is to deploy the Socrata Open Data Platform
broadly. Every agency within the entire federal government could run Socrata at a lower
aggregate cost as Socrata is a cost effective, cloud-based platform that offers benefits due to
economies of scale and economies of scope.

The cost savings are significant. Our estimates suggest that Scotia's SODA platform could host the data from every
U.S. Governmental agency for what the U.S. Patent and Trade Office (USPTO) _alone_ spends to publish
the patent and trademark databases; or for a _lower_ aggregate cost than what the U.S. Courts
spend to run the PACER court electronic records system.

Once broadly deployed, the Socrata Open Data Platform will modernize the way every
government organization delivers information and would provide these organizations with a common,
standards-based foundation for reducing the cost and improving the quality of data-driven service
delivery.

## Moving Beyond Government Data
Socrata is a platform company that views "data access" as a problem that
plagues not only the public sector, but also the commercial sector. Socrata views the public sector
as an important demonstration of the utility of the SODA platform. We have demonstrated that governments
can make their data broadly accessible to 300 million Americans. The platform can is just as useful
to commercial businesses that want to make their data privately accessible to their own analysts,
information workers and programmers.
