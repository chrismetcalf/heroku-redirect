      Notifyre allows you to subscribe to updates about a particular address. When fires are reported in your area via [data.seattle.gov](http://data.seattle.gov)'s [real-time fire 911](http://data.seattle.gov/Fire/Seattle-Real-Time-Fire-911-Calls/kzjm-xkqj) dataset, it notifies you via text message. Notifyre is also open source and available via Github, so it serves as a great "getting started" example on building applications via the [SODA API](http://dev.socrata.com).
